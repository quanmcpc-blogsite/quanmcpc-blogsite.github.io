Hello there! This is where I will (or I might) post blog about me, about my website, or maybe just random stuff. Since this is not my main website, I might not update this very often so I'll try to make the website as beautiful and stable as possible.

This blogsite used only vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, with the addition of Open Sans font (Not Comic Sans) with [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) (A JS script to parse Markdown to HTML).

I know that this is copied from the main page of the blogsite, but I'm too lazy.
