## Stupidity, Ignorance and Regret

Oh gosh, how can I even start this story...

So you might know that my blogsite's address is [https://quanmcpc-blog.github.io/](https://quanmcpc-blog.github.io/), but due to my stupidity, I can no longer log into my blogsite's GitHub and Outlook account. And how did it happend?

Well, this morning, I want to make the blogsite to show up on Google so I've go to GSC (Google Search Console), added the domain and it gave me a verification file (so that I can put the file into the root of my website). After I've downloaded the file, I've go to GitHub.com so I can access the repo, but I saw that I was logoff. `Oh, maybe GitHub auto logoff me after inactive for long time. No problem, I'll just log in back.`. So I've go to the GitHub page, enter my login detail  and... `Invalid username and password` is that it have told to me. Then I keep re-typing the password, and again, and again, and again but nope, still that `Invalid password` thing. The same thing also happened when I tried to log into the Outlook account. Since I can't log into the account anymore, I've decide to try and recover the account (as most human being would do) and oh boy, it was a mess.

- First, I tried the `Forgot password` option and since I haven't add any recovery email, nor recovery phone number, I was bring to the `Recover your account` page. Then I just follow the instruction: "Enter my main email", "Solve the Captcha". After all of that, I was bring to the page where you'll have to answer question like `First name`, `Last name`, and more information of the account to verify identity. I tried and fill in as much information as possible and... `Not enough information to verify identity`. So that's the first option ruled out.

- Next, I tried and called the Microsoft support number (Which is `1800400470` for VietNam) and it told me to `F*ck off becaus-` just kidding, it told me that `You have to go "account.live.com/password/reset" to reset password.`. Yeah..., welp, second option is ruled out.

- After 2 trial, I was left with the final option: Just give up. It was a hard option since it's my account but since I've tried every possible method, it's best to just let it go and create a new account instead. And that's why you're reading this from a different domain.

So, what can you learn from this blog? Don't be an idiot and make sure that you atleast add an recovery option. Or else, if you forgot your password, then it's game over for that account.

I know that there might have been other method to get the account back, and if you able do find a method, email me at `quanmcpc-blogsite@outlook.com` (Pls don't send spam).
