## Stupidity, Ignorance and Regret

Oh gosh, how can I even start this story...

So, you might know that my blogsite's address is [https://quanmcpc-blog.github.io/](https://quanmcpc-blog.github.io/), but due to my stupidity, I can no longer log into my blogsite's GitHub and Outlook account. And how did it happen?

Well, this morning, I want to make the blogsite to show up on Google so I've gone to GSC (Google Search Console), added the domain and it gave me a verification file (so that I can put the file into the root of my website). After I've downloaded the file, I've gone to GitHub.com so I can access the repo, but I saw that I was logoff. `Oh, maybe GitHub auto logoff me after inactive for long time. No problem, I'll just log back in.` So, I've gone to the GitHub page, enter my login detail and... `Invalid username and password` is that it has told to me. Then I keep re-typing the password, and again, and again, and again but nope, still that `Invalid password` thing. It also happened when I tried to log into the Outlook account. Since I can't log into the account anymore, I've decided to try and recover the account (as most human being would do) and oh boy, it was a mess.

- First, I tried the `Forgot password` option and since I haven't added any recovery email, nor recovery phone number, I was bringing to the `Recover your account` page. Then I just follow the instruction: "Enter my main email", "Solve the Captcha". After all of that, I was bringing to the page where you'll have to answer question like `First name`, `Last name`, and more information of the account to verify identity. I tried and fill in as much information as possible and... `Not enough information to verify identity`. So that's the first option ruled out.

- Next, I tried and called the Microsoft support number (Which is `1800400470` for Vietnam) and it told me to `F*ck off becaus-` just kidding, it told me that `You have to go "account.live.com/password/reset" to reset password.` Yeah that was pointless, welp, second option is ruled out.

- After 2 trials, I was left with the final option: Just give up. It was a hard option since it's my account but since I've tried every possible method, it's best to just let it go and create a new account instead. And that's why you're reading this from a different domain.

So, what can you learn from this blog? Don't be an idiot and make sure that you at least add a recovery option. Or else, if you forgot your password, then it's game over for that account.

I know that there might have been other method to get the account back, and if you able to find a method, email me at `quanmcpc-blogsite@outlook.com` (Pls don't send spam).
