## Is it hard to make a website?

If you're reading this, then once in your life, you might think that "`Oh I want to also create a website but it's too hard to make`". Well, let me tell you, even though it can be challenging at first (and other times), you'll soon find out how fun is it to create a website.

### I. The easy way.

Let say you're a **business** or a **normal person who just like to post stuff** (me in a nutshell) but you don't want to spend the time learn to code, then there's thing like **website builder** that allow you to build website with just drag and drop. And most of the time, you won't even have to do the complicated thing like "`responsive layout`" or "`SEO`". Because all of that shit is handled by the hosting service it self.

Although of course, you not getting thing like **source code editing**, and you of course has to pay if you don't want watermark across your website. But again, if you don't care about watermark or source code and just want to create a website, then a drag and drop interface is perfect for you. (Note that some service do allow you to insert HTML, CSS and JS code into your website.)

### II. The (maybe a bit) hard way.

Do you want the **deepest customization**? Do you want to see every single **bit** of data in your website? Then of course, learn **HTML**! With quite a lot of service offer storage for you to put **HTML**, **CSS** or **JS** or even **PHP, ASP, JSP** code. This of course has the draw back of a bit more **challenging** to actually create a website. Like you'll have to deal with **CSS styling**, **code optimizing**, **setup the server**, etc. Although different service will offer different level of customization, different tools, different ways to use so you'll have to also study on how to **use** the hosting service.

Overall, I'll say that with a bit of effort and learning, you'll be able to customize your website (and maybe the service) as much as you want.

### III. The (between easy and hard) way

Well then, there's another way, Which is to use an HTML generator! You'll have an easy to use interface (sometime drag and drop, sometime like an word processor) but you'll able to turn it into an HTML document which then you can load to the storage that your hosting service provider.

### IV. That's it
